MUHAHAHA way too much to do to tell...



in general
x remove all wm parts from 'compiz' i.e. strip out all unused parts
x rename everything to ecomorph
+ keep plugin compatibility with compiz
x fix synchronisation between e's desktops and ecomorph viewports (or better add viewport support to e)
x fix sync between window movements triggered by ecomorph
  (in general again: let ecomorph act as something like an ewmh pager and make e ewmh compilant in this regards)
- write a window decorator that uses e's border themes... and the dropshadow module 
- write a module that reads the metadata spec files and creates config dialogs from them
x trigger all plugin actions via dbus by an e module 
  - add edge/corner events to e
+ get window icons from e
- use efl for core
- switch to xcb branch someday :/
...

___________________________________________________________________________________
priority fixies:
- remove '_e_border' window class hacks

+ use desktop atom for e's background
- send event to uniconify windows 

x move border with deskflip correctly

x place windows correctly after restart of e (claws is not brought to front... claws bug? :p)
  (hack atm, but works ok)

x get sticky window property... atm only the window on the 
  desk where it was made sticky should be moved
  (expo movement of sticky window still does not work) 



___________________________________________________________________________________
bugs
- not all window with _e_border class are w->managed ?!
- audacious playlist is lost somewhere when setting audacious sticky 
 -> get it back with 'cleanup windows' on the origin desk 
- expo : the desk must be selected before one can move fullscreen/maximized window correctly 
- toggle keybindigns that were deactivated by mouse must  be deactivated by re-pressing th key before 
  other plugin actions can be activated-> ecomp needs to send a deactivation event

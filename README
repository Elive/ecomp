ecomorph - OpenGL compositing manager

for nice defaults:
install libecompconfig
copy ecomp to ~/.config

if you have an ati card with free driver:
export LIBL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 

for intel cards this seems to work:
export LIBL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 
export INTEL_BATCH=1

---- dont use gnome- or xfce-terminal to run it !!! -> use xterm ------------

/usr/local/bin/ecomorph fade dbus scale > /dev/null

or run ecomorph.sh ;)

note scale is not fully workung yet and probably not in near future

btw you can start scale with:

 dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.freedesktop.compiz /org/freedesktop/compiz/scale/allscreens/initiate_all org.freedesktop.compiz.activate string:'root' int32:`xwininfo -root | grep id: | awk '{ print $4 }'`

cheers
